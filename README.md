# Arduino_I2C_Library
An I2C library for Arduino as an alternative to Arduino's standard Wire library. 
I2C functions are broken down to steps so it can be easier to read an I2C device from its datasheet. 

To use:
1. Clone this repository in to your Arduino/libraries folder.
2. Restart Arduino and add #include <i2c.h> to the top of your sketch.
3. Refer to the example to see how to use the library to read and write to I2C devices.
